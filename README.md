I created this repository to help me learn how to communicate with fragments. 

My usecase: 

I needed an activity that was hosting a parent fragment. To be able to communicate from the parent fragment to the children fragments. See I needed a generated string be used in the child fragments. This helped me do that. The reference to the Medium article that helped me. I just created this to help myself and made it as simple as possible. 

Hopefully it helps others as I didn't believe that I was able to find something that was to my personal liking so I made my own.
